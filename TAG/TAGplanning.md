## TAG Planning ##

* Direct TAG count in the genome is uninformative because of contigs and scaffolds format

* Can try to do an alignment from this, or count TAG in transcriptome

* To determine impact for genes, can map transcript of TAG genes in the genome, find longest scaffold and predict new sequence until next stop
* Flag those that do not appear
