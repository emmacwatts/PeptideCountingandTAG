## PeptideCounting

Calculates number of peptides for total NbDE Proteome after digestion at 'R' and 'K', allowing for 2 missed cleavages. Function also available to exclude peptides by size. Returns total peptide count for the full proteome, and in the case that all peptides are labelled.

##TAG

Count instances of TAG codon in the NbDE transcriptome. Work in progress: calculates extended protein sequences for sequences that end in TAG.
